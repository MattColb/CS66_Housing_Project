# CS66_Housing_Project

Our project, Shelter Insecurity and the Rent Fluctuation Correlation, 
will determine an interrelationship between the homelessness rate and the variation in rent in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
We will be analyzing data from the 50th Percentile Rent Estimates from the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which gives the 50th percentile housing price by number of bedrooms per county. 
We will also use a data set of Craigslist housing rentals in different neighborhoods in the Bay Area. 
To evaluate the homelessness rate, we will utilize data from the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH). 
These datasets are provided in the form of two-dimensional array data structures, 
which we will transform with Python packages, such as Pandas, Dash, and Plotly, to make a simple interactive web application to display our information. 
At the conclusion of this project, we will present a visualization of a real-world problem with an opportunity to see a predictive solution.
